    How it works?
</div>
<div class="thirdsec">
    You will enter your tasks in pairs based on the following:
    the task that you must finish before the second one and the second task that is less important than the first 
    then click to (Try) to get a sequence of tasks ordered from the most important or urgent for you to the least one
</div>
<p >
   <span>For Example:</span> 
   if you have 3 tasks and the third one is more important than the second you enter 3-2 and 
   if the second is more important than the first you enter 2-1
   so if you entered:
   3-2 in the first line then
   2-1 in the second line
   the sequence will be ordered according to its importance for you (3,2,1) task 3 is the most important then second task then task one has the least importance.
   you can enter strings as well.
